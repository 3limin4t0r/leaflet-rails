Quickstart Guide
================

To start using the leaflet-rails gem, follow the steps below (assuming you use the default asset pipeline):

First, add the following code to your `Gemfile`.

```ruby
gem 'leaflet-rails'
``` 

Then, run `bundle install` from within your project to download the necessary files. Following that, open your application-wide CSS file (`app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`) and add the following line as a comment:

```
= require leaflet
```

If you require support for Internet Explorer, add the following line as well:

```
= require leaflet.ie
```

After that, open your application-wide Javascript file (typically `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`) and add the following line before requiring files which depend on Leaflet:

```
= require leaflet
```

At this point, you may skip the first two steps of the [Leaflet Quick Start guide](http://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start.html) and start at the third step (adding the map `div` to a view).
